goupnp is a UPnP client library for Go

## Installation

Run `go get -u github.com/fsedano/goupnp`.

## Documentation

See [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) for a quick start on the most common use case for this
library.

Supported DCPs (you probably want to start with one of these):

- [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp?status.svg) av1](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp/dcps/av1) - Client for UPnP Device Control Protocol MediaServer v1 and MediaRenderer v1.
- [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp?status.svg) internetgateway1](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp/dcps/internetgateway1) - Client for UPnP Device Control Protocol Internet Gateway Device v1.
- [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp?status.svg) internetgateway2](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp/dcps/internetgateway2) - Client for UPnP Device Control Protocol Internet Gateway Device v2.

Core components:

- [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp?status.svg) (goupnp)](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp) core library - contains datastructures and utilities typically used by the implemented DCPs.
- [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp?status.svg) httpu](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp/httpu) HTTPU implementation, underlies SSDP.
- [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp?status.svg) ssdp](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp/ssdp) SSDP client implementation (simple service discovery protocol) - used to discover UPnP services on a network.
- [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp?status.svg) soap](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsedano/goupnp/soap) SOAP client implementation (simple object access protocol) - used to communicate with discovered services.

## Regenerating dcps generated source code:

1. Build code generator:

   `go get -u github.com/fsedano/goupnp/cmd/goupnpdcpgen`

2. Regenerate the code:

   `go generate ./...`

## Supporting additional UPnP devices and services:

Supporting additional services is, in the trivial case, simply a matter of
adding the service to the `dcpMetadata` whitelist in `cmd/goupnpdcpgen/metadata.go`,
regenerating the source code (see above), and committing that source code.

However, it would be helpful if anyone needing such a service could test the
service against the service they have, and then reporting any trouble
encountered as an [issue on this
project](https://github.com/fsedano/goupnp/issues/new). If it just works, then
please report at least minimal working functionality as an issue, and
optionally contribute the metadata upstream.

## Migrating due to Breaking Changes

- \#40 introduced a breaking change to handling non-utf8 encodings, but removes a heavy
  dependency on `golang.org/x/net` with charset encodings. If this breaks your usage of this
  library, you can return to the old behavior by modifying the exported variable and importing
  the package yourself:

```go
import (
  "golang.org/x/net/html/charset"
  "github.com/fsedano/goupnp"
)

func init() {
  // should be modified before goupnp libraries are in use.
  goupnp.CharsetReaderFault = charset.NewReaderLabel
}
```

## `v2alpha`

The `v2alpha` subdirectory contains experimental work on a version 2 API. The plan is to eventually
create a `v2` subdirectory with a stable version of the version 2 API. The v1 API will stay where
it currently is.

> NOTE:
> 
> * `v2alpha` will be deleted one day, so don't rely on it always existing.
> * `v2alpha` will have API breaking changes, even with itself.
